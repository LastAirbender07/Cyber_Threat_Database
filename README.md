# Cyber_Threat_Database

This little project is made for our(a team of 5) 3rd semester.
Here I have used MySQL as Backend Database and Python for frontend, I have also used Django for linking my python file with my Website for accessing my website.
This is not fully over yet, as it requied knowledge beyond my capacity at that point of time.

This project contains a python code which is conncted to MySQL, we can add the information of a malware or any other cyber threat and access the information through the website as a user.

This project is developed for creating awareness among common people about the importnce of data and how these threats tamper with data.
